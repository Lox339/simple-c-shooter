# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Simple C Shooter with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Simple C Shooter, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@simple-shooter.dev
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Security Measures

Simple C Shooter implements several security measures:

#### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Buffer overflow protection in C/C++ code
- Safe string handling practices

#### Memory Safety
- Bounds checking on array accesses
- Proper memory management and cleanup
- Use of safe C library functions where possible

#### Network Security
- No network functionality in current version
- Future multiplayer features will implement proper authentication

#### File System Access
- Limited file system access to game directory
- No execution of external programs
- Safe handling of configuration files

### Known Security Considerations

#### Native Code Risks
- The game uses C/C++ which can be vulnerable to memory corruption
- We use static analysis tools to detect potential issues
- Regular security audits of critical code paths

#### Third-Party Dependencies
- All dependencies are regularly updated
- Security advisories are monitored for used libraries
- Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface

#### Platform-Specific Considerations
- Windows: DEP and ASLR enabled
- Linux: Stack protection and fortification enabled
- macOS: Code signing and notarization for distribution

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to the project, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Review
- All code changes require review before merging
- Security-sensitive changes require additional scrutiny
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

#### Safe Coding Practices
```c
// Good: Bounds checking
if (index >= 0 && index < MAX_ENEMIES) {
    enemies[index] = new_enemy;
}

// Bad: No bounds checking
enemies[index] = new_enemy;
```

```c
// Good: Safe string handling
strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - 1);
dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0';

// Bad: Unsafe string copy
strcpy(dest, src);
```

#### Memory Management
```c
// Good: Check allocation success
char* buffer = malloc(size);
if (buffer == NULL) {
    handle_allocation_failure();
    return;
}
// ... use buffer ...
free(buffer);
buffer = NULL;

// Bad: No error checking
char* buffer = malloc(size);
// ... use buffer ...
free(buffer);
```

### Security Testing

We perform regular security testing including:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime testing with tools like Valgrind
- **Fuzzing**: Input fuzzing to find edge cases
- **Penetration Testing**: Manual security testing

### Disclosure Policy

When a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. **Private Fix**: Develop and test the fix privately
2. **Security Release**: Release the fix as a security update
3. **Public Disclosure**: Announce the vulnerability after users have time to update
4. **Credit**: Acknowledge the reporter (with their permission)

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after a fix is developed
- Clearly marked as security releases
- Accompanied by detailed security advisories
- Backported to supported versions when necessary

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Security Team**: security@simple-shooter.dev
- **Maintainers**: Available through GitHub
- **Emergency Contact**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature

### Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and will acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Hall of Fame for security researchers (coming soon)
- Public recognition in release notes
- Coordination with CVE assignment if applicable

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. If you see something, say something!
